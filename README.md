###New Repository Requests for the CA APM Developer Community.

We're happy you want to contribute!  Details and instructions can be found on the CA APM Developer Community at https://communities.ca.com/docs/DOC-231150910.  

In a nutshell...

If you would like to contribute to any of our existing projects, simply fork them to your own personal account, make your edits, and then create a pull request to notify us of your intent to merge your contribution back to the CA APM organization.

If you have a new repository (project) that you would like to contribute to our organization, please first read the contribution instructions at the link above and then use the ISSUES page of this repository at https://github.com/CA-APM/-new-repository-request/issues.  This will notify us of your new project request.  We will then clone your repository, review its content, make necessary changes, and merge into our own repo.  Your issue (request) should include the following information:

1. Issue title should be “new request” and the description should explain your work and make it clear why it would be a good contribution to the community. 
1. What does it do?
1. How does it work? (EPA plugin, PBD file, name formatter, etc.)
1. What versions of APM does it work with?
1. What versions of APM has it been tested with?
1. Provide the link to your github.org public repository so we can copy your content.
